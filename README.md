# JavaScript Weather App

FInd the live website [here](https://rlweatherapp.netlify.app)

I started learning learning AJAX and I had to do a project to practice what I have learnt. I know we have a lot of this out here but doing this, I learnt a lot and can do more going forward.

The UI is pretty engaging and easy to navigate. Theres's a button to change default temperature unit for those in different regions.
